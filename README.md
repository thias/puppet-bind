# puppet-bind

## Overview

Install and enable a BIND DNS server, manage its main configuration and install
and manage its DNS zone files.

* `bind` : Main class to install and enable the server.
* `bind::server::conf` : Main definition to configure the server.
* `bind::server::file` : Definition to manage zone files.
* `bind::package` : Class to install the server package (included from `bind`)
* `bind::service` : Class to manage the server service (included from `bind`)

The split between `bind` and `bind::server::conf` allows to use a static file
or a different template-based file for the main `named.conf` file if needed,
while still using this module for the main package, service and managing zone
files. This is useful if you have a large and/or complex named.conf file.
Note that you may also use the `bind::package` and `bind::service` classes on
their own, though you won't need to if you use the main class, which includes
them both.

## Examples

Here is a typical LAN recursive caching DNS server configuration :

```puppet
include bind
bind::server::conf { '/etc/named.conf':
  listen_on_addr    => [ 'any' ],
  listen_on_v6_addr => [ 'any' ],
  forwarders        => [ '8.8.8.8', '8.8.4.4' ],
  allow_query       => [ 'localnets' ],
  zones             => {
    'myzone.lan' => [
      'type master',
      'file "myzone.lan"',
    ],
    '1.168.192.in-addr.arpa' => [
      'type master',
      'file "1.168.192.in-addr.arpa"',
    ],
  },
}
```

The zone files for the above could then be managed like this :

```puppet
bind::server::file { 'myzone.lan':
  source => 'puppet:///modules/mymodule/dns/myzone.lan',
}
bind::server::file { '1.168.192.in-addr.arpa':
  source => 'puppet:///modules/mymodule/dns/1.168.192.in-addr.arpa',
}
```

Then if all source files are in the same location and named after the zone :

```puppet
bind::server::file { [ 'myzone.lan', '1.168.192.in-addr.arpa' ]:
  source_base => 'puppet:///modules/mymodule/dns/',
}
```

For RHEL5, you might want to use the newest possible bind packages 
(otherwise if you're using `bind-chroot`, you'll need to check
whether the zone files need to be placed inside the chroot, e.g.
`/var/named/chroot/var/named`. Doing this unconditionally will break
the newest versions of BIND if zone files are deployed before `named`
is started for the first time, so be careful):

```puppet
class { '::bind': packagenameprefix => 'bind97' }
```

Since SELinux offers a very high level of protection, chrooting is quite
redundant, so it's disabled by default. You can nevertheless enable it if
you want :

```puppet
class { '::bind': chroot => true }
bind::server::conf { '/etc/named.conf':
  # [... same as before ...]
}
bind::server::file { 'myzone.lan':
  zonedir => '/var/named',
  source  => 'puppet:///files/dns/myzone.lan',
}
```

To avoid repeating the `zonedir` parameter each time, you can also use :

```puppet
Bind::Server::File { zonedir => '/nfs/zones' }
```

The module also supports views, where the main `zones` will be included in all
views, and view-specific `zones` may be declared :

```puppet
bind::server::conf {
  zones => {
    'example.com' => [
      'type master',
      'file "example.com"',
    ],
  },
  views => {
    'trusted' => {
      'match-clients' => [ '192.168.23.0/24' ],
      'zones' => {
        'myzone.lan' => [
          'type master',
          'file "myzone.lan"',
        ],
      },
    },
    'default' => {
      'match-clients' => [ 'any' ],
    },
  },
}
```

You can use the `statistics_channels` parameter to set up one or more statistics channels.

`statistics_channels` is a hash of hashes. Each nested hash sets up a statistics channel 
and contains the listening IP address and port for the channel and the IP addresses/address 
blocks or ACLs that are allowed to access the channel:

```puppet
bind::server::conf { '/etc/named.conf':
...
  statistics_channels    => {
    'channel-1' => {
      listen_address => '*',
      listen_port    => '8053',
      allow          => ['127.0.0.1', '10.0.0.0/8'],
    },
    'channel-2' => {
      listen_address => '*',
      listen_port    => '8054',
      allow          => ['127.0.0.1', '10.0.0.0/8'],
    },
  },
...
}
```
